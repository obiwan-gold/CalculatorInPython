# Calculator

The **calculator** module contains the main logic and functionality of the calculator application.

## calculator.py

The `calculator.py` file implements the `Calculator` class and its methods for performing arithmetic operations.

## Operations

The **operations** module provides classes for handling different types of operations. Currently, it includes the following operations:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

Each operation is implemented as a separate class within the module.

## Input Handling

The **input_handling** module is responsible for handling user input, validating inputs, and providing error handling mechanisms. It includes functions and classes related to input processing and validation.

## Output Formatting

The **output_formatting** module handles the formatting and presentation of the calculator's output. It includes functions and classes for formatting results, displaying output in specific formats (e.g., decimal, fraction, scientific notation), and handling special cases (e.g., division by zero).

## User Interface

If you're planning to build a graphical user interface (GUI) for the calculator, you can create a separate module called **user_interface**. This module would contain components, event handling mechanisms, and user interaction-related code.
